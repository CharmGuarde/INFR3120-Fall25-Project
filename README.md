# Charm & Karnan Project Part 3
## Overview
For our final project, we created a simple Task Manager. 

A web app that allows users to add tasks/assignments with due dates and a description. 
It gets added to a list and are given options to edit, delete and click done.
Data inputted are secure and visible to your own account.  

We implemented course material such as EJS, Bootstrap, CSS, Awesome Fonts, Authentication, MongoDB, and Node.js.
Other resources we used were found online.
