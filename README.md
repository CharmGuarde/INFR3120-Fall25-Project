Project Part 1 Idea

Our product, called Task Manager, is a straightforward web application that lets users create and organize their to-do list or daily activities in one location. By offering a simple interface for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting personal assignments, this program aims to assist users in maintaining organization. By providing a digital platform that is instantly accessible through a browser, it does away with the necessity for paper lists or disorganized notes.

The Task Manager's name and a simple, original team logo will appear at the top of the landing page. Additionally, all of the current tasks will be shown in a table format with details like the work name, description, and completion status. The user can add new tasks to the list by clicking the "Create Task" button, which opens a straightforward form. Complete CRUD functions will be available to users, including the ability to create new tasks, view and edit existing ones, and remove tasks that are no longer required.

This web application focuses on fundamental web development ideas like dynamic content rendering, form-based user interaction, and Node.js and Express backend connection. It is simple to use, lightweight, and displays every component needed for the initial project release, such as a home page, data creation, a functional table view, and functional CRUD functionality. This initial release will concentrate on creating a clear, fully functional foundation; subsequent iterations may incorporate task categories and login systems.
